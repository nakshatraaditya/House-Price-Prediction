# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. The project is built using Python and popular data science libraries including Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing relationships between different features and the target variable to gain insights and identify important predictors.
- **Model Selection:** Implementing and comparing different regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to identify the best-performing model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Cross-Validation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Google Colab
